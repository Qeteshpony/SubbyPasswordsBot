# Password Strength Bot

This telegram bot checks the "password" that was generated by a cutie. You can add it to any 
telegram group and call it by replying to the "password" with /check

You can also test it by directly talking to [@SubbyPasswordsBot](https://t.me/SubbyPasswordsBot).
Any private message will be rated immediately.
